Using EXCEL to show the you can minimize chi2 easily enough by hand.

One nice feature of using a spreadsheet is an outlier (i.e. a single point with a large chi2) would
stick out and could easily be investigated.   NOTE:  Please do not just drop outliers, but it is
reasonable to see what they are and double check them for any obvious errors (e.g. was the number
typed in correctly)

Along with changing variables by name to minimized chi2, one can also use the EXCEL solver to do
the minimization.   While this is faster then the by hand solution, it should give the same result.
