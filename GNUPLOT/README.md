# Example of a GNUPLOT fit with a graphical display of the results.

The logic of this code is try to follow the directions found within the 1963 Hand paper.
The first fit takes all the data from 0 to 3 fm^(-2) to determine an quadritic fit
parameter and then passes that result to a fit of low Q2 data.

Type "gunplot hand-1963.gnu" to run the script.
