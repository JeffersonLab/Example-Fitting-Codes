"The accurate values of GE, at low q2 enable us to
state the derivative $(dGE/dq2)$ at $q2$ = 0 accurately.
We use the data in Table I q2 = 1.05 fm^{-2}. It is
neeessary to use a quadratic fit to $G_E = ——1 —1/6(r)q2
+ Aq4$, using values of q2 up to 3 fm^{-2} to determine the
parameter A.   The data are quite consistent and we
deduce
(dGE/dq ) at q2=0 is -0.108 & 0.003 fm^{-2}
where the rms radius of the proton is given by
(r) = 0.805 & 0.011 fm."
