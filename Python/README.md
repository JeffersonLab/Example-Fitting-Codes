"The accurate values of GE at low q2 enable us to
state the derivative (dGE/dq2) at q2 = 0 accurately.
We use the data in Table I q2 = 1.05 fm^{-2}. It is
neeessary to use a quadratic fit to GE = 1 —1/6(r)q2 + Aq4 
using values of q2 up to 3 fm^{-2} to determine the
parameter A.   The data are quite consistent and we
deduce (dGE/dq ) at q2=0 is -0.108 & 0.003 fm^{-2}
where the rms radius of the proton is given by
(r) = 0.805 & 0.011 fm."
