# Example Fitting Codes

This page is to proivde a number of fitting codes.    To make the fits a real world example, we make use of the table of proton form factors
found in L.N.Hand, D.G.Miller and Richard Wilson, Review of Modern Physics 35 (1963) 342 to make proton radius extractions using classic data.

* Excel - using a spreadsheet allows one to see how the minimization works
* R - powerhouse fitting program with tons of diagnostic plots
* GNUPLOT - a powerful tool for making pretty plot and doing basic fitting
