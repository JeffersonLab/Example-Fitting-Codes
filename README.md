# Example Fitting Codes

This page is for example fitting codes.    For these fits we make use of the table of proton form factors
found in L.N.Hand, D.G.Miller and Richard Wilson, Review of Modern Physics 35 (1963) 342.

* Excel - using a spreadsheet allows one to see how the minimization works
* R - powerhouse fitting program with tons of diagnostic plots
* GNUPLOT - a powerful tool for making pretty plot and doing basic fitting
